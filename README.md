# 📊 Retail Sales Data Analysis Project (Microsoft Excel)

## Project Overview

This repository contains an Excel project demonstrating foundational and intermediate data analysis and reporting skills using a **Retail Sales Dataset**. The goal of this project was to practice essential Excel functions, create dynamic summaries, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales performance.

The primary deliverable is an organized and formatted Excel workbook (`retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx`) containing the analysis, pivot tables, and visualizations.

## ⚙️ Skills & Functions Demonstrated

The following core Excel features and functions were applied in this analysis:

### 1. Data Aggregation & Conditional Analysis
* **`SUM`**: Calculated total sales/revenue.
* **`AVERAGE`**: Determined the average price per unit and average quantity sold.
* **`SUMIF` / `AVERAGEIF`**: Used for conditional calculations, such as finding the total sales for a specific `Product Category` or the average price for a specific `Gender`.

### 2. Data Lookup & Joining
* **`VLOOKUP`**: Implemented to retrieve and integrate specific data points from separate sheets (e.g., bringing in product category or customer details into a summary table).

### 3. Dynamic Reporting & Visualization
* **Pivot Tables**: Created powerful, flexible summary reports to aggregate data by dimensions like `Date`, `Product Category`, `Gender`, and `Age`.
* **Pivot Charts**: Developed dynamic charts (e.g., Bar Charts, Line Charts) linked to the Pivot Tables to visualize sales trends, performance by category, and customer demographics.
* **Slicers**: Integrated interactive **Slicers** to allow for quick, intuitive filtering of the Pivot Tables and Charts, enhancing the user experience and enabling on-the-fly analysis.

### 4. Presentation & Formatting
* **Formatting**: Applied professional number formatting (currency, percentages) and used **Conditional Formatting** to highlight key data points, such as highest/lowest sales values in the reports.

## 💡 Key Analysis & Insights

The project setup allows for a drill-down into several key business questions, including:

* Total Revenue and average transaction value.
* Sales performance segmented by **Product Category**.
* Customer purchasing behavior analyzed by **Gender** and **Age** group.
* Quantity sold and price distribution across the dataset.
