# 📈 Excel Data Analysis Portfolio: Financial & Sales Reporting Projects

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis and reporting projects completed in **Microsoft Excel**. The projects focus on applying core Excel functions, dynamic reporting tools (Pivot Tables, Slicers), and professional data visualization techniques across various datasets, including **Retail Sales**, **Global Bike Sales**, and **Historical Weather Data**.

***

## ⚙️ Core Excel Skills Demonstrated

The following skills were practiced and implemented across these projects:

### Data Aggregation & Lookup
* **Functions**: Practiced using `SUM`, `SUMIF`, `AVERAGE`, and `AVERAGEIF` for calculating totals, conditional totals, and averages.
* **Data Integration**: Utilized **`VLOOKUP`** to integrate or enrich data by pulling information from different tables or sheets.

### Reporting & Visualization
* **Dynamic Summaries**: Created and customized **Pivot Tables** to summarize large datasets by various dimensions (e.g., date, product, country).
* **Interactive Analysis**: Enhanced reports with **Slicers** for quick, interactive filtering of Pivot Tables and Charts.
* **Visual Presentation**: Developed **Pivot Charts** (e.g., line, bar, pie charts) for visualizing key metrics and trends.
* **Formatting**: Applied professional **Formatting** (e.g., conditional formatting, custom number formats) to improve readability and presentation.

## 📊 Project 1: Retail Sales Performance Analysis

### Description
This project focuses on general retail transaction data. The goal was to calculate fundamental sales metrics and analyze purchasing patterns across different customer demographics and product categories.

### Key Analysis Areas
* Total sales and average price per unit.
* Conditional metrics (e.g., total sales by **Product Category** or **Gender**).
* Age and gender distribution of sales.

### Dataset Files
* `retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx - retail_sales_dataset.csv`
* `retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx - Transactions.csv`
* `retail_sales_dataset_Master.xlsx - Day 2 Task 2.csv` (Also includes basic task examples like calculating averages and applying filters/sorting on a small sample.)

## 🚴 Project 2: Global Bike Sales Reporting

### Description
A detailed case study on a global bike sales dataset. This project heavily utilized advanced reporting tools to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for sales and profitability tracking.

### Key Analysis Areas
* **Revenue and Profit Trends** over time (e.g., yearly performance).
* **Geographic Sales Performance** by Country.
* **Product Performance** across different product categories (Bikes, Accessories, Clothing).
* Sales distribution segmented by **Age Group** and **Gender**.
* All summary reports utilize **Pivot Tables** and are controlled by **Slicers**.

### Dataset Files
* `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab - Copy.xlsx - Sales Data.csv`
* `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab - Copy.xlsx - Revenue and Profit by Year.csv`
* `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab - Copy.xlsx - Product Revenue by Country.csv`
* `Bike_Sales_Visualizations_Lab - Copy.xlsx - Revenue by Age Group.csv`
* `Bike_Sales_Pivot_Lab - Copy.xlsx - Bike Sales.csv`

## ⛈️ Project 3: Historical Atlantic Hurricanes Data

### Description
This project focused on data manipulation and sorting techniques applied to a smaller, public dataset of historical Atlantic hurricanes. The emphasis was on organization, filtering, and simple calculations on weather event data.

### Key Analysis Areas
* Calculating summary statistics for **Damage (USD Millions)**.
* Filtering and sorting hurricanes by **Category** and **Max Wind Speed**.
* Organizing data by event date (`Start Date`).

### Dataset File
* `Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes -1.xlsx - Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes.csv`
